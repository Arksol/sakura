# sakura

minimal ***classless*** css *framework* / **theme**.

Just drop in `sakura.css` to any webpage and go from
ugly looking 1900's website to a pretty modern website
in literally 0 seconds.

Sakura supports extremely easy theming support using
variables for duotone color scheming.

Comes with several existing themes, can be found in the
`css` folder of this repository.

## Installation

1. Download the file:

   ```
   wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oxalorg/sakura/master/css/sakura.css"

   ```

2. Link it from html:

    ```
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="sakura.css">
    ```

**(Optional)** *but recommended*, use
[normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/)
to reset before using sakura.
